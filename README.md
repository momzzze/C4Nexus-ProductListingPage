[Download Assignment PDF](./assignment.pdf)

Summary:
Day1:
First day of the build was 23.02.2026. 've built an initial version + the grid and styles.
I decided to use React with TypeScript and Vite for the project setup. I created a context to manage favorites and cart state, which is persisted in localStorage. Why? Because its only MVP and I want to keep it simple and not add more complexity with state management libraries.
For the easy of development, I use only one css file for the whole project, I plan at the end to split to each folder/tsx css file approach first i want to build it and then refactor it to be more maintainable.
I also added some skeletons for the loading state of the products this is one of the reasons to use real api not mock data.
I also added header and footer parts with load more functionality for the products.
Day2:
Small progress with fixing some product mapping of the images.(Some of the PRs were with data from the previous day).
I had some issues IRL so I could not work on 100%.but I manage to plant the context and the things that i need for cart and favorites its not in the requirements but I want to do it since I have 7 days.

Difficulties:
Day1: - I had some issues with the mock data I decided to use some free APIs since I don't know dealing with the chatGPT I stop on the API called https://dummyjson.com because reason one don't need api_key and reason two the dummy products inside were good identical images without background that allowed me to build a good looking product listing page. I wont add pagination because it's not needed we have load more button.
Its hard for me to without figma to add good small logo and icon that was pain for me too but since i do not have license for figma.
Day2: - There were no major difficulties only bugfixes and planing what i will do in the next day.
